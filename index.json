The main focus is on providing a mathematical proof for the convergence of the iterates of an SVD-based algorithm. In contrast to the conventional approach by the so called alternating least squares (ALS) method that works to adjust one factor a time, the SVD-based algorithms improve two factors simultaneously. The ALS method is easy to implement, but suffers from slow convergence and easy stagnation at a local solution. It has been suggested recently that the SVD-algorithm might have a better limiting behavior leading to better approximations, yet a theory of convergence has been elusive in the literature. This note proposes a simple tactic to partially close that gap.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Convergence analysis of an SVD-based algorithm for the best rank-1 tensor approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Guan","Delin Chu."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a7f8f27c37e8cee6f5500e48965d1bc6","permalink":"https://guanyu7.top/publication/journal-article4/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article4/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we study the orthogonal low-rank approximation problem of tensors in the general setting in the sense that more than one matrix factor is required to be mutually orthonormal, which includes the completely orthogonal low-rank approximation and semiorthogonal low-rank approximation as two special cases. It has been addressed in [L. Wang and M. T. Chu, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 35 (2014), pp. 1058--1072] that “the question of more than one semi-orthogonal factor matrix, except for the case of complete orthogonality, remains open.” To deal with this open question we present an SVD-based algorithm. Our SVD-based algorithm updates two vectors simultaneously and maintains the required orthogonality conditions by means of the polar decomposition. The convergence behavior of our algorithm is analyzed for both objective function and iterates themselves and is illustrated by numerical experiments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Numerical computation for orthogonal low-rank approximation of tensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Guan","Zhaojia Tong."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e742187ea36c14a88e5db8c319a32de4","permalink":"https://guanyu7.top/publication/journal-article1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article1/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we mainly derive the general solutions of two systems of minus partial ordering equations over von Neumann regular rings.

First, in contrast to the many long and lingering arguments in the literature, it offers a straightforward justification that generically the best rank-1 approximation to a symmetric tensor is symmetric. Second, in contrast to the typical workhorse in the practice for the low-rank tensor approximation, namely, the alternating least squares (ALS) technique which improves one factor a time, this paper proposes three alternative algorithms, based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) that modifies two factors a time. One step of SVD-based iteration is superior to two steps of ALS iterations. Third, it is proved that not only the generalized Rayleigh quotients generated from the three SVD-based algorithms enjoy monotone convergence, but also that the iterates themselves converge.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"SVD-based algorithms for the best rank-1 approximation of a symmetric tensor","type":"publication"}]
